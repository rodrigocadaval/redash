# This is an example configuration for Docker Compose. Make sure to atleast update
# the cookie secret & postgres database password.
#
# Some other recommendations:
# 1. To persist Postgres data, assign it a volume host location.
# 2. Split the worker service to adhoc workers and scheduled queries workers.
